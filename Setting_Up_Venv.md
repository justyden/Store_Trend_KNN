### Setting Up the Venv
- Creating a new venv __conda create -n your_env_name__
- If there is no current venv and you want to create a new one that grabs everything from environment.yml just do conda __env create -f environment.yml__ in the terminal.
- To update an already existing venv do __conda env update -n your_env_name -f environment.yml__
- Make sure the directory is correct and also to replace your_env_name with the name desired.
- Please include any additional needed packages into the environment.yml file.
